# keylogger
This project is a basic keylogger built with Python for educational and ethical research purposes only. It captures keystrokes from the user's keyboard and logs them to a local file. The main objective is to demonstrate how keylogging works and how attackers may abuse such techniques, helping defenders better understand and prevent such threats.
